# :ballot_box_with_check: Online Voting System

## :rocket: Introduction
The **Voting System Application** is a web-based solution designed to facilitate the process of adding candidates, casting votes for predefined political parties, and displaying election results. This user-friendly platform ensures secure and efficient vote management, providing real-time updates and results.

## :question: Problem Domain
Traditional voting systems can be prone to inefficiencies, delays, and lack of transparency. These issues may arise due to manual vote tallying, lack of digital records, and limited accessibility for voters. Ensuring fairness and accuracy while providing a convenient interface for managing votes is critical.

## :wrench: Solution Domain
The Voting System Application addresses these challenges by:
- Allowing voters to securely cast votes for predefined political parties.
- Providing instant updates to the vote tally, ensuring transparency and accuracy.
- Displaying results in real-time with insights on the winning party or ties.

## :computer: Technology
The application leverages modern web technologies for scalability and ease of use:
- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework for handling server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: HTML templates rendered with Flask, along with Bootstrap for a responsive design.
- **Data Storage**: In-memory dictionary for vote management (can be replaced with a database for scalability).

## :books: Data Structure Used
- **Arrays/Lists (Data Structure)**: Used to store predefined political parties.
- **Dictionaries (Data Structure)**: Used to track the vote counts for each political party.
- **Sorting (Algorithm)**: Sorting vote counts in descending order to display results.
- **Searching (Algorithm)**: Searching for the selected party in the predefined list.
- **Conditionals/Comparisons (Algorithm)**: Handling vote validation and tie-break scenarios.

## :star: Key Features
